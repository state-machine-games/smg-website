    <p>
      Newly-demoted in an obscure department, you start with nothing. As you explore & connect islands claimed by the company, you'll build a growing production network, manage & multiply your workforce, and overcome intricate performance review puzzles to rise back up the corporate ladder.
      <br/><br/>
      Your employer has unlimited resources and an iron-clad grip on the passage of time, and a perpetual contract has left you stuck working in the same time loop for decades. As you gain authority and trust, however, you'll be armed with the ability to manipulate time yourself. If you can exploit a loophole in Company Time, you'll finally be able to escape -- or stop any of this from ever happening.
